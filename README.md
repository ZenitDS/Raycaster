# Raycaster
This is a project where you can walk around in a simulated 3D world. It uses the same technique as in "Wolfenstein 3D"
It has only been tested in windows and I'm not sure if it will work properly in other Operating Systems.
It´s a raycaster with textures.

MOVEMENT
W A S D : Move the character forward, backward, right and left.
Arrow keys(Left and Right) : Rotate the camera.

TO USE
You can analize the source code but if you only want to play it download the zip and execute the main.exe file.

BUGS
Please, report any bugs you encounter for forward improvements.

There´s not much more to it, have fun!!
